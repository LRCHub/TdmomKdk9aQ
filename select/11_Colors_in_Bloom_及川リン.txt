When we hit a mountain
A wall that we can't get through
Don't get down or discouraged, baby
We just have to
Paint it past
Paint it air
Paint the other side
We can paint it into our life
Maybe we can't open
The carge that's tryin' to keep us
Get your brush and your painitin' shoes
On grab your pallet
Paint it free
Paint it out
Paint it big blue sky with you,
Painting brilliant days
Hey!
It's groovy and so beautiful
So charming being with you
Hey!
I feel so alive and in tune
So charming, colors in bloom
With a stroke we can paint the world brand new
Paint it pink
Paint it blue
Yellow or black as night
Paint it green
Paint it red
Purple or golden while
If we got the blues
And they just keep getting darker
We don't need to take it, baby
We just gotta
Paint it smile
Paint it love
Paint it laughter bright
With you painting colorful days
Hey!
It's groovy and so beautiful
So charming being with you
Hey!
I feel so alive and in tune
So charming, colors in bloom
Hey!
It's groovy and so beautiful
So charming being with you
Hey!
I feel so alive and in tune
So charming, colors for two
Hey!
It's groovy and so beautiful
So charming being with you
Hey!
I feel so alive and in tune
So charming, colors in bloom
It's so nice to get colorful with you
